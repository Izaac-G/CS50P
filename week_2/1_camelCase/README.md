# camelCase CS50P Week 2 Problem 1

Prompt:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/2/camel/

Steps:
1) Create a main function to store our variables. We will need a variable to store the camel case string and a variable to store our snake case string.
2) Create a function to translate the camel string to snake string.
3) Declare an empty string that we will use to hold our output.
4) To check if a character needs conversion, we will loop through each character in the camel string. 
5) Construct an if/else statement within the for loop that either returns lowercase letters as they are or converts uppercase letters to lowercase letters with an underscore prefixing them.
6) Return the new string to the main function to be printed.
