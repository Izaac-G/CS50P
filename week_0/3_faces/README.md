Steps:
1) Create our functions as defined in the prompt.
2) Fill in the main function by prompting the user and passing this string to the convert function. We can prefill the print() here as we know we want to print the result.
3) For our convert function, we can use the [str.replace()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods) method 
4) Return our transformed string and print.
