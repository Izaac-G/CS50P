# Indoor Voice CS50P Week 0 Problem 1

Prompt:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/indoor/

Steps:
1) To start off clean, we will make sure our code is defined in a function. For future problems this step will be implied.
2) We must prompt the user for a string and store this string in a variable that we will transform later, we will do this with the input function.
3) We can transform this string to lowercase using the str.lower() method (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
