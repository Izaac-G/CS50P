Steps:
1) Retrieve the expression from the user, the split using the [string.split()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith) method (while we have not reviewed this method in the course, it is provided in the Python string docs )
2) After splitting x, y, and z we will need to convert x and y to floats that way we can perform math operations on them
3) Construct a match/case statement for each of our 4 possible operators 
4) Print the result of the user's expression
