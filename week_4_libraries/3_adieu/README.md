Prompt:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/4/adieu/

Steps:
1) Create a variable to call the engine class from the inflect module
- The [inflect](https://pypi.org/project/inflect/) library is used to handle english inflections. We will use it here to join a list of names into a grammatically correct sentence.
2) Create a while loop, prompting the user for names and adding them to a list. 
3) Apply the inflection engine to the list of names
4) Print the desired sentence, calling the list of names (It will now be properly formatted)
