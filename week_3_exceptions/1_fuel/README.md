Prompt:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/fuel/

Steps:
1) Initialize a function for prompting the user for a fraction and converting their answer to a percentage
2) Create a while loop so that any invalid user input results in being remprompted for a fraction
3) Prompt the user for input, only accepting fractions in the x/y format. We can use the [split function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) to seperate the x and y values.
4) Convert the input to a percentage and use an If/Elif statement to check if the values meet the given criteria
