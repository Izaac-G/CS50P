# Felipe's Taqueria Week 3 Problem 2

Prompt:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/psets/3/taqueria/

Steps:
1) Create a dictionary containing all the menu items as the keys and the item price as the values
2) Use a while loop to prompt the user for their chosen menu item and add the item price to the total cost for their order.
    - Make sure to convert the user's inputted string to [title case](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title) as that is how we are storing the dictionary keys
3) Allow for the user to exit the program using Ctrl+D (the [EOF](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#EOFError) signal)
